# Recreate
 
In this Unity Project, I will be recreating some of my favorite mechanics from games that I enjoy/find interesting. 

Current Unity Version: 2019.3.7f1

After each recreate is finished a package will be uploaded into the RecreatePackages folder in the root folder. Please keep in mind that packages do not include things like Layers, Tags or base project settings, so it is advised to clone or download the project with just the desired recreate.
